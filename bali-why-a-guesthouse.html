                        <p class="lead">Why this website has born? Who is it for? What is a Guesthouse? We get
                            often asked these questions from users and obviously not everyone knows
                            what one really mean talking about a Guesthouse. The idea of this website
                            has born after some travels in Indonesia during the early 2000s, to Bali,
                            the Island of the Gods, the ideal destination for a vacancy in the broad
                            sense, where culture and religion, nature and simple life create a mix
                            of unforgettable atmospheres sought-after travels. From the beginning when
                            we planning a travel, the principal purpose of the most of the people,
                            is to saving money for the overnight, and then choose to stay in the countless
                            low-cost Guesthouses in the area, which objectively have a good price/quality
                            ratio, which change, as usual, according to the location, the closeness
                            of the infrastructures, and the services offered. By using the term ‘Guesthouse’
                            we intend to indicate an accommodation comparable to a hostel, a small
                            hotel, a Bed &amp; Breakfast or Homestay, which peculiarity is to have
                            a low-average cost, and which offers basic rooms (low-cost) with toilet,
                            and in some cases also a balcony, with a family-run business or not. In
                            many cases, in the locations which had become the most famous tourist attractions,
                            the Guesthouses in the area were nothing more than private household that
                            the locals decided to convert to actual lodging houses to sleep, in response
                            to the strong tourist demand, let’s think of the Cuban “Casa Particular”,
                            or the “Studios” throughout Greece. No wonder if you can find guesthouses
                            in the most sought-after tourist attractions, in particular the highly
                            frequented areas during the whole year, and surprisingly, we can find also
                            guesthouses on the Maldivian atolls, the African forests, in the Seychelles
                            paradise and so on. Many owners put their passion and dedication in this
                            “conversion” of their home and this spread positively to the guest. These
                            accommodations allow the guests to accommodate at reasonable prices compared
                            to the other more expensive solutions, but still having the standard services
                            of a normal tourist facility, such as, room cleaning, assistance, breakfast
                            included, and also more attention to the customer compared with a hotel.
                            However, sometime the restricted budget may involve some differences in
                            the expectation of a hotel: for example, while the latter usually has a
                            24/7 and seven days a week staff assistance, guesthouses have a much more
                            limited staff attendance and therefore sometimes this can implicate doing
                            the check-in by appointment only or in specific time slot. There are different
                            services offered: many guesthouses offer their homemade cooking so the
                            guests can taste the typical local products and lot of the times they can
                            eat together with the other fellow dinner which are in the other accommodations,
                            creating a sort of communitarian and joyful atmosphere, bringing the guest
                            in the local daily life staying strongly in contact with the local life,
                            the tastes, habits, embarking a journey within a journey, having very different
                            experiences compared to the ones they could have in the tourist resorts
                            or in the Hotels; it is like touching with your hand the everyday reality,
                            sharing experiences by having a closer view of the customs and traditions
                            of the country and the people, making them happy to host and greet the
                            travellers. Thus, on this website, among the many options, we propose Guesthouses
                            with common kitchen which can be useful for saving money while eating (by
                            avoiding to eat in a restaurant which is certainly much more expensive)
                            and are also a way to make new friends and eat all together. There are
                            others with a laundry room, private or shared bathroom and private parking
                            for motor-scooters; they can offer a shared swimming pool and Wi-Fi internet
                            connection. Others can benefit of a spectacular view of the sea or the
                            mountain, lake or river and in some cases even the Volcano view. Guesthouses
                            have different targets: university students with a limited budget, families
                            with 4/5 members who wants to strongly reduce their expenses preferring
                            this kind of accommodations; backpackers that want to limit the costs to
                            afford a long time travel and couples who prefer the “familiar” simplicity
                            and tranquillity instead than a hotel solution. Summarizing, there are
                            a lot of benefits in staying in a Guesthouse:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>• Affordable price • Extremely informal
                            <br>• Possibility to share some time with the local family
                            <br>• Many of these are near the tourist locations, so they are convenient
                            as a base from which you can go to explore the area
                            <br>• If you are not satisfied about the place, after all you’ve just waste
                            some dollars.

                            <br>Many times people get lost on the internet searching for low cost hotels
                            and often ended in finding just a name or a telephone number; sometime
                            the facilities we find have no adequate information technology systems
                            for the online booking, such as an email or they have no visibility on
                            the internet, and this make the searching very limited and very hard to
                            book. Starting with the assumption that the inserted Guesthouses have been
                            selected and approved by us because they respond to the quality and professional
                            standards that we consider appropriate to be inserted on our website, OUR
                            PURPOSE is therefore to guarantee to You, the travellers, A SAFE AND EASY
                            SEARCHING SERVICE AND BOOKING, in the searching for a Guesthouse for your
                            travel, choosing among a variety of economic accommodations which is possible
                            to select according to the chosen parameters, (e.g. area of interest, price
                            for room, breakfast, etc.). These are our parameters and we are confident
                            that these are yours too. &lt;br&gt;
