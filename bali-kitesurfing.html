          <p class="lead" contenteditable="true">Kitesurf, born as a recreational sport in 1980, has not gained a lot of popularity until the end of the millennium when there were about a thousand kite surfers in the entire world but in 2005 the number increased at almost 10.000 and today the number of kite surfers is awesome. This aquatic discipline born from the cohesion of surf, windsurf and wake forzad, allow to let the wind push ourselves standing on a board with a kite, and sometimes it seems like flying on the waves giving to the kite surfer a sensation of freedom, power and sprint. It creates a sort of kite surfers’ community on the beaches, where you can admire many colourful kites trailing the kite surfers into the sea; in fact, today, the are a lot of fans searching for location around the world where they can practice this sport but these locations must have the predominant peculiarity of Kitesurf: the wind! To the delight of many, also Bali, the Island of Gods, it’s a destination which can offer a lot also for a vacation dedicated to kitesurf, even if it is an important location for surf.&nbsp;<br><br>In Bali there are 2 monsoon seasons and the best moment to test yourself in kitesurf would be during the south-west monsoon summer, from June to August even if there could happen windy months like May or September.&nbsp;</p>
